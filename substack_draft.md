# The War Metal Vault: Leveraging UAMY to Flex Some Tech Chops
**By MPH (and a very efficient AI assistant)**

Opinions are Beta. Data is Alpha. And puns? Puns are just... *metal*. (I’m sorry, I had to).

Most people look at the ticker `UAMY` and see a number on a screen. I look at it and see a silver-lining—literally. Antimony is a brittle, silver thing that everyone ignored until they realized it was the only thing standing between a modern missile and a very expensive paperweight. It’s the "War Metal" nobody wanted to talk about, until suddenly, everyone did.

In years past, I’d start digging up EDGAR filings manually. Now? I have Gemini and Python doing my work for me lol... let’s be honest here, it’s just more efficient. Why dig a hole with a spoon when you have a backhoe? I am **LEVERAGING** this deep-dive into UAMY to show you exactly how to build your own research engine—cross-referencing management claims against 5 years of OHLC data, Form 4 insider buys, and geospatial satellite logs that see things the PR department hopes you ignore.

The result? The **UAMY Deep Research Vault**. It’s more than a notebook—it’s a script for a play that hasn't finished yet. It’s also a masterclass in how to use **NotebookLM** and **Python** to find your own edge.

## THE FORMATION: THE RESEARCH VAULT
If you’ve never used NotebookLM, don’t overthink it. It’s an AI-powered brain that only knows what I’ve fed it. It’s like a storyteller who actually remembers their citations—and doesn't have a "mining" accident when asked for sources.

![NotebookLM Interface Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mphinance/alpha-playbooks/main/assets/notebook_ui_guide.png)

*   **The Roster (Left Panel):** The dry, dusty truth. 10-Qs, **Fastmarkets Sb** benchmarks, and procurement logs. Every answer the AI gives is tied to a page number. No hallucinations here—just cold, hard evidence.
*   **The Huddle (Center Panel):** Interrogate the storyteller. This is where the Python chops meet the AI. Ask it the questions management avoids at cocktail parties. "Where is the $352M backlog actually coming from?" or "Is Gary C. Evans a visionary or just very good at buying his own stock?"
*   **The Studio (Right Panel):** The "Alpha" zone. It turns the noise into music. Look here for **Slide Decks**, **Audio Overviews**, and the **Strategic Outlook**.

## THE PLAY: THE “POWER PROMPT”
I’ve already taught the AI how to weave this tale. This is where we **LEVERAGE** the prep work. To get a professional-grade Investment Memo that balances the "Transformation" with the "Trap," copy-paste this directly into the Chat panel:

> **COACH’S TIP (or a Dad Joke if you prefer):** 
> *What did the miner say to the Antimony? "You're looking a bit brittle today, but I'm sure you'll find your metal."*
> 
> **The Real Power Move:** Copy-Paste this legacy prompt:
> *"Create a comprehensive 'Investment Memorandum & Risk Analysis' for United States Antimony Corporation (UAMY). Focus on the '2026 Transformation Thesis' versus the 'Execution Trap' bear case. Include details on the $352M contract backlog, the raised $125M revenue guidance, the Q3 2025 earnings miss, and the specific operational status of the Stibnite Hill mine and Thompson Falls smelter. Integrate the 'Project Vault' and 'Tariff Floor' geopolitical context. Highlight management's history and the 'ineffective controls' risk factor."*

## COACH’S CLIPBOARD (THE SCOUTING REPORT)
The data is singing a very specific tune right now, and it’s not a lullaby (those are for people who aren't watching the tape):

1.  **The $352M Backlog:** A number this big is either a miracle or a target. It’s cited across three procurement docs. This is a 10x revenue inflection if they can execute. (Executing is the hard part—just ask my Python script when I forget a semicolon).
2.  **Geospatial Ground Truth:** Stibnite Hill isn't just a dot on a map. Our analysis confirmed 800+ tons of ore removed in Q4 2025. The dirt is moving. That’s a "groundbreaking" development. (See what I did there?)
3.  **The Evans Signal:** CEO Gary isn't just whistling in the dark. A **$613k open-market buy** in September 2025 is a high-conviction play. Insiders buy for many reasons, but they rarely do it when they expect the story to end poorly.

## THE TECHNICAL STAT SHEET (UAMY)
*   **Formation:** Bullish Stacked (SMA 50 > SMA 200). We are sailing with a very stiff wind.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Strong Bullish (Golden Cross territory).
*   **Pivot Point:** $9.16. (The "Line-in-the-Sand" for the current chapter).
*   **Support Cluster:** $6.24. If the story takes a dark turn, this is where we find our footing.

## THE VERDICT: DON'T GET TRAPPED BY SENTIMENT
The internet is a cacophony of opinions. I am **LEVERAGING** the utility I built for myself because it turns out, showing your technical chops is the best way to build trust. Plus, having an AI that roasts your own business plans is just good for the soul.

*Disclaimer: Opinions are my own. Mining is high risk. The data is real, but execution is a fickle mistress... much like my code before the 3rd cup of coffee.*

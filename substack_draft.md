# The War Metal Vault: A Story of Antimony and Artifice
**By MPH (with a bit of Wit)**

Opinions are Beta. Data is Alpha. And stories? Stories are the only things that actually matter when the world starts to burn.

Most people look at the ticker `UAMY` and see a numbers on a screen. I look at it and see a story about a metal called Antimony—a brittle, silver thing that everyone ignored until they realized it was the only thing standing between a modern missile and a very expensive paperweight.

I’ve spent the last week digging through the guts of the domestic supply chain so you didn’t have to. I didn’t just read the SEC filings; I built a Python-powered research engine to interrogate the vault. I cross-referenced management claims against 5 years of OHLC data, Form 4 insider buys, and geospatial satellite logs that see things the PR department hopes you ignore.

The result? The **UAMY Deep Research Vault**. It’s more than a notebook—it’s a script for a play that hasn't finished yet.

## THE FORMATION: THE RESEARCH VAULT
If you’ve never used NotebookLM, don’t overthink it. It’s an AI-powered brain that only knows what I’ve fed it. It’s like a storyteller who actually remembers their citations.

![NotebookLM Interface Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mphinance/alpha-playbooks/main/assets/notebook_ui_guide.png)

*   **The Roster (Left Panel):** The dry, dusty truth. 10-Qs, **Fastmarkets Sb** benchmarks, and procurement logs. Every answer the AI gives is tied to a page number. No hallucinations here—just cold, hard evidence.
*   **The Huddle (Center Panel):** Interrogate the storyteller. Ask it the questions management avoids at cocktail parties. "Where is the $352M backlog actually coming from?" or "Is Gary C. Evans a visionary or just very good at buying his own stock?"
*   **The Studio (Right Panel):** The "Alpha" zone. It turns the noise into music. Look here for **Slide Decks**, **Audio Overviews**, and the **Strategic Outlook**.

## THE PLAY: THE “POWER PROMPT”
I’ve already taught the AI how to weave this tale. To get a professional-grade Investment Memo that balances the "Transformation" with the "Trap," copy-paste this directly into the Chat panel:

> **COACH’S TIP (or perhaps just a friendly suggestion):**
> *"Create a comprehensive 'Investment Memorandum & Risk Analysis' for United States Antimony Corporation (UAMY). Focus on the '2026 Transformation Thesis' versus the 'Execution Trap' bear case. Include details on the $352M contract backlog, the raised $125M revenue guidance, the Q3 2025 earnings miss, and the specific operational status of the Stibnite Hill mine and Thompson Falls smelter. Integrate the 'Project Vault' and 'Tariff Floor' geopolitical context. Highlight management's history and the 'ineffective controls' risk factor."*

## COACH’S CLIPBOARD (THE WIT’S SCOUTING REPORT)
The data is singing a very specific tune right now, and it’s not a lullaby:

1.  **The $352M Backlog:** A number this big is either a miracle or a target. It’s cited across three procurement docs. It’s a 10x revenue inflection, assuming they don't trip over their own shoelaces.
2.  **Geospatial Ground Truth:** Stibnite Hill isn't just a dot on a map. Our analysis confirmed 800+ tons of ore removed in Q4 2025. The dirt is moving, even if the progress is silent.
3.  **The Evans Signal:** Our CEO Gary isn't just whistling in the dark. A **$613k open-market buy** in September 2025 is a high-conviction play. Insiders buy for many reasons, but they rarely do it when they expect the story to end poorly.

## THE TECHNICAL STAT SHEET (UAMY)
*   **Formation:** Bullish Stacked (SMA 50 > SMA 200). We are sailing with a very stiff wind.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Strong Bullish (Golden Cross territory).
*   **Pivot Point:** $9.16. (The "Line-in-the-Sand" for the current chapter).
*   **Support Cluster:** $6.24. If the story takes a dark turn, this is where we find our footing.

## THE VERDICT: DATA IS THE ONLY HONEST STORYTELLER
The internet is a cacophony of opinions, most of them sung by people who haven't read the sheet music. I am giving you the tool I built for myself because in a world of artifice, utility is the only currency that doesn't devalue.

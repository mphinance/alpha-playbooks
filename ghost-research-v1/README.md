# Alpha-Playbook Generator

A high-performance stock analysis and intelligence report generator. This system fetches real-time market data, technical indicators, and news feeds to produce professional "Mission Control" HUD reports and standardized JSON data models.

## Core Features
- **Parallel Data Fetching**: Concurrent retrieval of price action, insider trades, and RSS news feeds.
- **Advanced Technical Analysis**: Full EMA stacks (8, 21, 34, 55, 89) and volatility modeling.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Robust charting using Plotly.js with zoom/pan and reset capabilities.
- **Intelligent Narrative**: AI-synthesized analysis and verdicts based on technical and fundamental scores.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Isolation & UI/UX Integration
The system is designed with a strict separation between analysis and presentation:
- **`[DATE].json`**: A minimized, focused JSON model containing scores, signals, and narratives. Ideal for external frontend developers or lightweight API integrations.
- **`[DATE]_series.json`**: The heavy time-series sidecar containing OHLC and technical study data.
- **Jinja2 Rendering**: The `generate_playbook.py` script serves as a controller that binds these JSON models into a final interactive HTML document.

### Specialized: Jinja2 Templating
The HUD's visual layer is powered by **Jinja2**, enabling a "Logic-in-Template" approach that keeps the Python backend clean:
- **Unified Context**: The template receives the full `data` object, allowing for dynamic iteration over news feeds, insider tables, and financial ratios.
- **Safe JSON Injection**: Critical for charting, Jinja2's `|safe` filter is used to bridge Python dictionaries directly into the browser's JavaScript memory without double-escaping issues.
- **JS Equivalency (Nunjucks)**: For teams working in Node.js, the template syntax is nearly 1:1 compatible with **Nunjucks**, making the transition from Python reports to JS-based web apps seamless.

## Future Roadmap: Data as an Endpoint
The project is evolving toward a **Commercial API Endpoint**. The standardized JSON structure (minus the HTML wrapper) provides:
1. **Developer Friendly**: The JSON is completely decoupled from the UI. A React or Vue developer can consume the "Signals" and "AI Narratives" without needing to understnd the underlying Python logic.
2. **Scalability**: Decoupled backend architecture ready for transition to a REST API.
3. **UI Agnostic**: Perfect for teams specializing in UIX who want to build custom interfaces on top of our institutional-grade analysis.

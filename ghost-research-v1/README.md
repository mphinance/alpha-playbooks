> **"I’m a trader and a coder, not a marketing guy."**

I like the nerdy shit. I like digging into market mechanics, writing code that actually does something useful, and finding ways to stack "free shares" through discipline. What I *don't* like is the marketing hype and the endless manual grind.

## 😫 THE OLD WAY (THE GRIND)
Before I built this, my research routine was a mess of tabs and wasted time:
1.  **Technicals**: Open TradingView, manually plot EMA stacks (8, 21, 34, 55, 89), check RSI, and hunt for monthly pivot levels.
2.  **Volatility**: Look up historical volatility, then check the option chain for implied volatility to see if a "squeeze" was actually building.
3.  **Intel**: Cycle through Bloomberg, WSJ, and CNBC to see if there was any news I missed that would blow up my trade.
4.  **SEC Filings**: Scour Form 4s to see if insiders were actually buying the dip or just dumping shares.
5.  **Valuation**: Open a spreadsheet and manually calculate Graham Numbers and Lynch Fair Value to see if I had any "Margin of Safety."

By the time I was done, the trade entry was either gone or I was too tired to take it.

## ⚡ THE BIG REVEAL
Now, I do all of that in exactly **10 seconds**. 

I built an engine that automates every single one of those steps and synthesizes them into a single, high-density HUD.

```bash
python3 generate_playbook.py --ticker ACHR
```

![HUD Mockup](alpha_hud_mockup.png)

One command. Every EMA, every news headline, every insider trade, and a blended valuation consensus. It spits out a glassmorphism HTML dashboard and a clean JSON API model. It’s institutional-grade intelligence without the manual labor.

## 💬 THE BIG QUESTION
Truthfully, I’m better at building than I am at "launching." I’m trying to figure out where this fits in the world.

**If you were using this every day to find your entries and exits, what would it be worth to you?**
- A monthly "Alpha Pass" subscription?
- A per-report "On-Demand" token?
- Something else?

I'm all ears. If you have thoughts on the value or just want to talk mechanics, let me know.
